### Flight to Tokyo ###

_You choose some background about how you have studied in the past, and where you intend to live when you arrive in Tokyo._

Everyone was happy and excited for you when you told them your plan to live in Japan and learn Japanese for a year or two.
"Maybe you will bring home a translator," your boss boasted with a huge smile.
Secretly you were worried it would all fall apart.

Ever since you were a teen you would fritter away money and time on games and books for role playing games. Dreaming of re-rolling stats, or getting into some time-slip and restarting everything. Leaving High school you didn't have much money saved. Your grades were good enough to get into University, so you moved to Melbourne and found a cheap share-house.
Quickly it all turned bad, all your things were stollen the first day you had classes. The last few things you owned you packed up in a backpack and lived on the street for a week before dropping out of your course, catching a Monday morning train home. Your parents didn't know, they hadn't called in the five weeks you had been away. At first they thought you were just home for an Easter Break.

* You failed to move away from home to go to Uni as a teenager (2002)
After High School you hadn't saved near enough money for moving away for Uni. But your grades were good enough and your were accepted into a Science program in Melbourne. Your found a share-house where a friend of a friend was moving out to go to 

* A huge set back (2011)
Then at 27 you were in a huge car accident. Induced in a coma for a 156hfew days and spent almost a year recovering. Going to weekly rehab, swimming, running, re-learning to read and write.


It is here that you starting learning Hiragana. Bored with tracing A, B, C. You purchased a book for learning kana, and started tracing Ka, Ki, Ku, Ke, Ko.

Looking for work again, getting Otaku - oriemo...
